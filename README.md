# Personal Project: ReactChat

This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

You can visit the live version [here](https://reactchat-dev.web.app/).

## Goals of this Project

I came into this project with the goal of creating my first dynamic website with database authentication and live updates.

## Challenges

I ran into many challenges along this journey mostly stemming from lack of initial organization and preparedness, which I don't blame myself for- it was my first site using a backend and I just didn't know how to be prepared. For example- I ran into the issue of not knowing how to reference a specific document in the backend, which ultimately I fixed by using "set()" instead of "add()" when writing to Firebase in the first place. There were also a few functions that I didn't plan for but wanted to add if my initial frontend and backend structure didn't make it so complicated.

## How I will apply this experience to my next project

1. Firstly, I'm going to take more time before my initial commit to design the frontend and backend structures to fit the features that I want- and those will also be planned!
2. I will also do a lot more learning on the concepts of new Frameworks I wish to use before my initial commit so I'm not asking "Well, why does this work?" when I'm using it. (Looking at you, Typescript...)

## Final Thoughts

This project was a bit of a "Trial by Fire" that I put myself through, I wasn't as prepared as I should have been so I faced a lot of challenges. That just means the next project will be a little easier and I know what to expect next time. Ultimately, I'm happy with how it came out and I know how to improve myself!
